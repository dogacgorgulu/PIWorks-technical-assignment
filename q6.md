Q6: Please estimate the number of base stations in Istanbul by explaining how you estimated this number.

The first solution I instantly came up with dividing the area of Istanbul into the area of average base station covers but since I have zero background on how base stations work or are installed, I would follow the following method.

I would gather a group of countries that are close to Turkey according to an index (such as HDI, GDP per capita, or telecommunication companies' annual revenue) that might be correlated with average base stations per km^2 installed.
Then I would try to find a data set of these countries' base station count per km^2.
Lastly, I would make my guess depending on the area of Istanbul.

It would be better to estimate based on similar cities instead of countries. Also instead of only considering the area of Istanbul, considering both the shape and area of Istanbul might result better.
