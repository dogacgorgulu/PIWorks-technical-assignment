Q7: If you were a product manager at WhatsApp, which two new features would you introduce? If you need to prioritize one of them since it is not allowed to develop features in parallel, based on which factors do you make your prioritization?

1. I believe, a lot of people use group chats on WhatsApp. I find it very hard to find my personal chats inside of those group chats and vice-versa. To solve this problem I would add a new section, very simple to navigate, on the chats screen to divide personal chats and group chats.

2. "Media, Links, and Docs" section provide an easier way to find content in chats. I would add a filtering option into media to filter photos from videos. The docs section includes .wav files but not voice messages recorded on WhatsApp. I would add a separate voice messages section.

I would prioritize the first feature since it has a higher chance to be used on a daily basis by many.
