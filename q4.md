Using [Segmented Sieve](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmented-sieve-print-primes-in-a-range/) is an option, however since the range is very small, I would simply go with [Simple Sieve](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/) and print numbers in the given range. I would never use the second approach if the sample size was bigger.
